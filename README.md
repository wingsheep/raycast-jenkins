### Motivation
The daily work often involves opening a web page, logging in, and searching for Jenkins jobs before starting the build. To simplify this process, this plugin was developed.


## Installation

Currently, you need to clone this repo and install it locally in developer mode.

You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed.

1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/wingsheep/raycast-jenkins.git`
2. Go to the folder `cd raycast-jenkins`
3. Install dependencies `pnpm install`
4. Go to Raycast, run `Import Extension` and select the folder

There is **no plan** to publish to the bloated [raycast/extensions](https://github.com/raycast/extensions) until they make a decentralized publishing system.
